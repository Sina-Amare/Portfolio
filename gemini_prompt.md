- Stack: Next.js 13.5.6, React 18.2.0, TailwindCSS 3.4.4, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui

---------------------------------------
üéØ TASK ‚Äî Professional Cinematic Visual Redesign
---------------------------------------

1. **Hero Section ‚Äî Cinematic Personal Showcase:**
   - Replace the current static hero with a **split layout** (2-column responsive design):
     - **Left side:** Introductory text and call-to-action.
     - **Right side:** A large, soft-focus **portrait image of Sina** (AI-generated placeholder until replaced manually).
   - Portrait styling:
     - Slight parallax depth using Framer Motion.
     - Soft radial lighting behind the portrait (cinematic tone).
     - Optional floating particle light or gradient glow around subject.
   - Background:
     - Gradient or soft blurred backdrop ‚Äî e.g.:
       ```css
       background: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 50%, rgba(37,99,235,0.15), transparent 70%),
                   linear-gradient(to bottom right, #0D1117, #1E293B);
       ```
     - Optional animated gradient transition or slow-moving light direction.
   - Text block content:
     - Heading (6xl): *‚ÄúEngineering Clarity Between Intelligence and Design‚Äù*
     - Subtext (xl): one sentence about design-engineering philosophy.
     - Two buttons: `View Projects` and `About Me`, with hover gradient and motion lift.

---

2. **Navigation & Footer:**
   - Implement a **floating transparent navbar** with soft blur:
     ```css
     backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
     background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.05);
     ```
   - Active links highlighted with gradient underline animation.
   - Footer design:
     - Gradient border-top (brand color accent)
     - Clean typography with small copyright note.
     - Subtle hover color transitions on links.

---

3. **About Section (Professional Narrative):**
   - Use a **horizontal split design**:
     - Left: Image container (portrait variant, half-body or workspace background).
     - Right: Text content with motion reveal.
   - Add light divider lines or subtle background transitions for readability.
   - Apply soft scroll fade-in animations (`opacity` + `y` motion).

---

4. **Color & Typography System:**
   - Base colors:
     - Primary: `#0A0A0A`
     - Accent: `#2563EB` ‚Üí `#00C6FF`
     - Surface: `#F9FAFB`
   - Fonts:
     - Headings: *Poppins* (bold, cinematic scale)
     - Body: *Inter* (light, readable, professional)
   - Maintain accessibility and contrast ratio.

---

5. **Visual Enhancements & Animation:**
   - Add **parallax scrolling** for hero and about.
   - Integrate **Framer Motion transitions** for smooth page loads.
   - Add **light trails or gentle floating gradients** in background layers.
   - Maintain smooth performance (60 FPS target).

---

6. **Mood & Composition Reference:**
   - Combine the emotional impact of cinematic personal websites with minimal UX clarity.
   - Inspiration:
     - Modern product landing pages (Apple, Linear, Vercel)
     - Elegant developer portfolios (balanced tech + creative tone)
   - Ensure the site feels *alive but not flashy*.

---

7. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Replace avatar with **AI-generated full portrait** (use placeholder image until final image provided).
   - Add **subtle section lighting** between transitions (hero ‚Üí about ‚Üí projects).
   - Integrate **hover-based camera movement** or **depth-based gradient response** for interactive realism.

---

8. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Test across resolutions (390px‚Äì1440px).
   - Validate responsive scaling of image and text.
   - Check motion consistency and load time (<2.5s).
