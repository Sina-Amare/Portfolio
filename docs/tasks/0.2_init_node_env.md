# Task 0.2 â€” Node Project Initialization

## Purpose

Initialize Node.js project with dependencies, build system, and quality tools.

## Implementation Summary

Installed Next.js, React, and React DOM as main dependencies. Added development dependencies including TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, Prettier, Contentlayer, and other utilities. Configured TailwindCSS manually due to npx issues. Set up ESLint with Next.js and Prettier integration. Created TypeScript configuration and added required scripts to package.json.

## Output / Results

Added scripts to package.json:

- dev: "next dev"
- build: "next build"
- start: "next start"
- lint: "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx"
- format: "prettier --write ."
- content:check: "contentlayer check"

TypeScript configured with target ES2020, module ESNext, and jsx set to preserve.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] `package.json` created
- [x] Dependencies installed successfully
- [x] ESLint + Prettier configured
- [x] TailwindCSS initialized
- [x] TypeScript setup validated

## Notes

Had to manually create TailwindCSS config due to npx issues. Needed to upgrade ESLint config to v9 format. There were dependency conflicts with next-contentlayer requiring an older version of Next.js, resolved with --legacy-peer-deps flag.
