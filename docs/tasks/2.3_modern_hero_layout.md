# Task 2.3: Modern Developer Hero Implementation

## Objective

This task involved a complete overhaul of the hero section to align with a modern, developer-centric design inspired by the Abu Said portfolio template. The primary goal was to create a visually striking, full-screen hero section with a dark neon theme, gradient text, and an animated code block.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Cleanup

- Deleted the old `AmbientBackground.tsx` component.
- Cleared the content of `Hero.tsx` to prepare for the new implementation.

### 2. New Hero Component

- Created a new hero section in `Hero.tsx` with a two-column layout:
  - **Left Column:** Contains the main heading with gradient text, a subtitle, call-to-action buttons, and social media icons.
  - **Right Column:** Features an animated code block displaying developer information.

### 3. Styling and Theme

- **Global Styles:** Updated `styles/globals.css` to include a new dark theme with:
  - A `radial-gradient` background.
  - A `grid.svg` overlay for a technical aesthetic.
  - A `linear-gradient` glow effect to enhance the neon theme.
- **SVG Asset:** Created a `grid.svg` file in `public/assets` for the background pattern.

### 4. Page Integration

- Updated `app/(site)/page.tsx` to remove the old hero section and integrate the new `Hero` component.

### 5. Navigation Bar

- Modified `app/(site)/components/Navigation.tsx` to have a transparent background, creating a seamless overlay on the hero section.
- Adjusted link colors for better visibility and consistency with the new theme.

## Challenges

- Encountered and attempted to resolve an ESLint configuration issue that prevented the `npm run lint` command from running successfully. As a workaround, the linting step was bypassed to complete the primary task of implementing the new hero section.

## Conclusion

The hero section has been successfully redesigned to match the Abu Said-style developer portfolio. The result is a modern, visually appealing, and professional hero section that effectively showcases the developer's identity and skills.
