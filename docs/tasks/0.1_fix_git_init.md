# Task 0.1 (Fix) â€” Correct Git Initialization

## Purpose

Remove incorrect outer Git repo and reinitialize Git correctly inside project root.

## Implementation Summary

Deleted outer `.git` directory and initialized a new Git repo within `sina-portfolio`. Added `.gitignore`, staged files, committed, and created development branch.

## Output / Results

(Show `git status`, current branch, and commit hash.)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] `.git` folder exists only inside `sina-portfolio`
- [x] `.gitignore` created successfully
- [x] Initial commit completed inside correct repo
- [x] `feat/setup-git` branch exists

## Notes

Corrected repository initialization to prevent nested or parent-level repo contamination.
