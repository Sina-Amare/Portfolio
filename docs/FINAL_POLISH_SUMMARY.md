## Component Updates

### Modified Components:

1. `app/(site)/components/Hero.tsx` - Import CopyButton, remove comma, integrate new copy button
2. `app/(site)/components/StatusBadge.tsx` - Absolute positioning
3. `app/(site)/components/Navigation.tsx` - Text-only hover
4. `app/(site)/about/page.tsx` - Major redesign, scroll animations, copy button
5. `app/(site)/skills/page.tsx` - Copy button integration
6. `components/ui/CursorEffect.tsx` - Enhanced size and speed
7. `components/ui/TerminalWindow.tsx` - Use new CopyButton component
8. `components/effects/PageBackground.tsx` - Complete rewrite
9. `styles/globals.css` - Professional scrollbar, removed nav CSS

### New Components:

1. `components/ui/CopyButton.tsx` - Universal copy button with animations

## Performance Considerations

- All background animations use GPU-accelerated transforms
- Limited to 10 max animated elements per page
- Backgrounds hidden on mobile (< 768px)
- `useInView` triggers once for optimal performance
- No layout shifts or reflows

## Visual Improvements

### Before â†’ After:

- Background opacity: 0.03 â†’ 0.12-0.15 (visible!)
- Cursor size: 8px â†’ 12px
- Scrollbar: Bright gradient â†’ Subtle gray
- About page: Boxed â†’ Open, integrated
- Tech stack: Auto-animate â†’ Scroll-triggered
- Navigation: Overlapping lines â†’ Clean single line
- Status badge: Fixed viewport â†’ Relative to hero
