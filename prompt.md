look at issue 1 and 2 .png
we got those icons already above contact me so whats hte purpose of having them again in footer ?
we also have the contact icons so why do we need contact me button ?
and we got the navbar+codebox overlap when scrolling down.
fix these and then add more styles , creativity , to this page .
make it as enhanced as possible but keep the minimalist mindset .
use up to date front end dev mindset , act as a senior .
